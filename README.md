For this project I was already given the environment of the game and only had to create the actual q learning algorithm. This involves first initializing the model with all input parameters. I also had to define the replay buffer and the initial weights and biases for the neural network. The tell the model to play the maze and iterate over each step it is taking, and to use the buffer to remember whether its different choices are better or worse than what it has done before. The model will then run through the maze enough times to where it solves the maze and ensures that it can always solve the maze. Each time it goes through the maze it will update its parameters. After it has finished training I asked it to show me how it solved the maze to ensure that it had actually managed to solve it. 
This course was a great introduction to the field of AI and machine learning within computer science. This is an interesting and clearly developing field with such powerful tools suhc as gpt and all the stable diffusion applications. This type of innovation is one of the reasons I enjoy computer science and hope to work in the field. Approaching these problems through a lens of applying data science and algorithms is very interesting. 
Although these solutions are ingenious and can seemingly be applied to more and more fields, it is also important to try and apply ethical restrictions to the work, so that it does not cause any real world negative outcomes.
